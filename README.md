# Heart-Disease-Prediciton-Using-ML-Techniques-
This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease. Specifically, I employed three different algorithms: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. These algorithms were trained on a dataset that included a variety of factors such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. By analyzing these factors, the algorithms were able to identify patterns and make accurate predictions about the risk of heart disease.

The project involved extensive data preparation, feature engineering, and model training. I also used various techniques to evaluate the performance of each algorithm, such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning. In the end, I deployed the best-performing model to make real-time predictions using streamlit , a free and open-source framework to rapidly build and share beautiful machine learning and data science web apps.

Overall, this project demonstrates the power of machine learning in predicting complex medical conditions and has the potential to be a valuable tool in healthcare settings.
